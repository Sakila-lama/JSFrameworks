                <p class="Bio">
                    <span>Hi, I'm Sakila Lama!</span>
                    Hey there! I'm a Computer Programming student at Georgian College, nearing the end of my final semester.
                    My passion lies in becoming a skilled programmer while completing my Computer Science degree.
                    I'm adept at both front-end and back-end development, with a strong proficiency in Java and JavaScript.
                    Alongside coding, I'm versatile across Mac, Linux, and Windows platforms.

                    My soft skills include being a quick learner and a dedicated team player, which I believe are essential in the fast-paced tech world.
                    Beyond the realms of programming, I thrive on learning new skills and have a keen interest in exploring fashion and food scenes.
                    You can often find me unwinding at cafes or simply chilling when I'm not engrossed in coding. Let's dive into the realms of technology
                    and life together! 👩‍💻🚀🌟
